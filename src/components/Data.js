According to agriculturist Dr. Alexander Campaner, based on the genetic characteristic of an Apple, it required 7 to 12 degrees Celcius temperature for it to grow.

Based from the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Forestry, and Natural Resources Research and Development(PCARRD): “Banana is the most economically important fruit crop in the Philippines, and it is the only locally-grown fruit available year-round”. The Banana Plant can be planted anywhere in the Philippines because of the overall climate. Planting should be done during or at the beginning of the rainy season. However, this could be done any time of the year if rainfall is evenly distributed.  The Banana plant can be grown in nearly all kinds of soil. However, it grows preferably in a deep, well-drained, fertile loam with high humus content with pH ranging from 5.0 to 7.0. It also requires a considerable amount of Nitrogen and Potassium to maintain higher yields. Temperature. The temperature requirement for banana growth is between 19°C to 27°C. Rainfall. The annual rainfall of 2,000 to 2,500 mm or 25 mm per week is best for bananas."

Its by-products such as coconut meat, oil, juice, husk, shell, shell charcoal, leaves, husk, pith, inflorescence, trunk and roots produces a variety of products. The coconut has 2 known varieties which are the dwarf variety and the tall variety. Basically, the dwarf variety is the small coconut trees that mature fast and produce nuts earlier than the tall variety. The tall variety on the other hand produces more nuts than the  dwarf variety. The country is considered to be the second top producer of coconut, next to Indonesia.  Exporting coconut has contributed 3.6% of Gross value added(GVA) in Agriculture. The top coconut producer in the Philippines is the Davao Region with 497.62 thousand metric tons output or 15.8 percent of the total coconut production. It is followed by Zamboanga Peninsula and Northern Mindanao with 14.2 and 13.7 percent shares, respectively. According to the PCA, there are about 3.5 million coconut farmers in the Philippines with 3.5 hectares of land planted with coconut trees. In growing coconuts, the land should not be flooded as the coconuts don't grow well on those. Those areas in the country that have a distinct dry season are not the best location to plant coconuts because the coconut trees need rain water."

Regional microclimates around the country also have an impact on the types cultivated in certain locations. However, in recent years, the country has not produced enough to meet its own needs. The coffee business has been affected by extreme weather and increasing urbanization. Although, things are beginning to change. The coffee business is being rejuvenated, and specialty coffee is becoming more popular, thanks to greater collaboration and infrastructural improvements. The following places are the places that grows the best coffee beans in the country: Batangas, Benguet, Sagada, Kalinga, Sulu Archipelago, Sultan Kudarat, Cotabato, Bukidnon, Davao, Cavite, Ilocos, and Iloilo. Coffee beans mature faster in lower and warmer locations than in higher and colder locations. After blooming, Arabica berries develop in 10 to 11 months. Robusta stories are 10 months old, while Liberica and Excelsa are 11 to 12 months old. The general harvest season lasts from October to March."

We can cultivate a wide range of cultivars here. Grapes like loose, deep soil with a ph less than 5, therefore lime treatment is beneficial. It is also beneficial to place decomposing leaves around the plant to keep the soil wet. Grapes want slightly sloping ground so that water does not accumulate and harm the roots. To avoid illness, grapes require lots of sunlight (not shadow) and excellent air circulation. Grapes are ready to harvest ten (10) to twelve (12) months after planting. Harvesting occurs three times a year: in September, December, and summer. Cebu, Ilocos Region, South Cotabato, Zamboanga, and other Visayas and Mindanao areas have extensive grape plantations. Grapes grow best in places with a warm, dry environment and enough irrigation. Locations that are often hit by typhoons and heavy rain are the least suited. Western Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, Panay, and the Negros Occidentales are ideal grape-growing locations. Growing conditions, on the other hand, differ depending on the type."

Jute thrives on a variety of soil types, including clay loam and sandy loam, according to the Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority (PhilFIDA). Jute sacks are long-lasting and may be reused several times, and because they are composed of natural materials, they do not harm the environment. Seeds kept in jute bags can also keep their germination quality. The Philippines still imports the majority of its jute packaging materials. Throughout the tropics and subtropics, the plant thrives in wet to semi-arid environments. Jute mallow thrives in hot, humid climates and is commonly found along riverbanks. Cold temperatures and prolonged spells of drought can be fatal to the crop. The land must be plowed and harrowed. During the dry season, the beds are 20 cm high, while during the rainy season, they are 30 cm high. The distance between furrows is 150 cm, and the bed tops are around 90 cm broad. During land preparation, apply 2 to 3 tons of organic fertilizer or compost per hectare. Saluyot can be harvested 30 days after transplanting by harvesting the crop at a height of 20 to 25 cm from the ground. Harvesting is repeated every 1 to 2 weeks for up to 7 months. Harvesting is best done in the late afternoon for the following day's market sale."
